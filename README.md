# bikeshare_py
This is an introduction to Python project that I completed part of an Udacity Data Analytics Nano-degree.

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
